# Sharma_Store_Analysis
The project was guided by #RishabhMishra on YouTube. It was my first project and help me a lot to understand the excel functions, data cleaning, data processing, analyzing and preparing dashboard.

Insights come from the analysis.

1). Women has contribution of 64% of total sales across all plat
2). Maharastra, Karnataka, UP, Telangana & Tamilnadu has 53% contribution in total sales
3). 55% of buyers are from adult age group(28 to 49 year old
4). Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra has 80% Contribution of total sales

Based on this insights I came to end of decision
Sharma store can target the adult women in  Maharastra, Karnataka, UP, Telangana & Tamilnadu on Amazon, Flipkart & Myntra. You can provide coupon, offers etc.

For reference i have attached the dashboard image.
